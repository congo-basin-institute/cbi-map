# CBI Maps

Web map experiments for the Congo Basin Institute.

To test performance and ease of use we will test web maps built with Leaflet, OpenLayers, MapBox and other web map APIs.

We use [OpenStreetMaps](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) for our [base map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

## What is Leaflet?

[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) is an open source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 38 KB of JS, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need. Leaflet is designed with _simplicity_, _performance_ and _usability_ in mind. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms, can be extended with lots of plugins, has an easy to use and well-documented API.

## What is OpenLayers?

[OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) is a open source, high-performance, feature-packed JavaScript library for all your mapping needs. OpenLayers makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page. It can display map tiles, vector data and markers loaded from any source. OpenLayers has been developed to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. It is completely free.

## What is MapBox?

[MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) is an open source mapping platform with a generous free version and a paid tier for commercial applications. MapBox APIs and SDKs provide developers tools to build locations into any mobile or web app.
